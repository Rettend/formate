# IMPORTANT

- Never try to fix linter errors and warnings yourself, most of the time they are autofixable, so just leave them and let me do it, you don't even need to mention them.
- The terminal is Windows CMD, so linux commands are not available.
- No need to care about backwards compatibility, no one uses the app, we change what we want.
